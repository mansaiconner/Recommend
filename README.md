Recommend movies based a prompt given by the user

The Movie dataset was downloaded from IMDB. I have it in my repository as "IMD-Movie_Data.csv"

Created a requirements folder for the libraries I used.

Used Jupyter Notebook to write and test my code.

The code reads the data, takes input from the user, cleans the input and the movie plots, then computes which movies are most similar to the users input.
